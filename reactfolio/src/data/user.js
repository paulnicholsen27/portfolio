			"Hi, I’m Paul Nicholsen—equal parts learning architect, code whisperer, and AI enthusiast. I’ve spent 15+ years turning complex tech into “I get it now!” moments, leading high-impact training programs, scaling global learning strategies, and occasionally explaining AWS to my cat. Whether I’m building backend systems, mentoring developers, or designing sleek digital experiences, I bring a blend of nerdy precision and educator charm. If you’re looking for someone who can teach, lead, code, and still make a killer dad joke, you’ve found your guy.",
