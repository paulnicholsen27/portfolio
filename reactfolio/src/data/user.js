			"Hi, I’m Paul Nicholsen—equal parts learning architect, code whisperer, and AI enthusiast. I’ve spent 15+ years turning complex tech into “I get it now!” moments, leading high-impact training programs, scaling global learning strategies, and occasionally explaining AWS to my cat. Whether I’m building backend systems, mentoring developers, or crunching data I bring a blend of nerdy precision and educator charm. If you’re looking for someone who can teach, lead, code, and still make a killer dad joke, you’ve found your guy.",

		description:
			"I began my career as a middle school math teacher with a Master's Degree in Education.  I eventually picked up programming as a hobby, and fell in love.  I was a full-stack developer among such notable institutions as Dow Jones, The Atlantic, and the Library of Congress (among others) until moving back into the teaching space by being the Lead Instructor at Flatiron School, a coding bootcamp, helping open a brand new campus in DC.  Since then, I have been a technical trainer for Amazon Web Services and Palantir, most recently serving as the Director of Training at L7 Informatics.",
